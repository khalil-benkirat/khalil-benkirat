Average <b>Bash</b> and <b>Arch</b> enjoyer.<br>
I'm learning to master Python and Rust in order to spend 5 hours automating a task that takes me 2 mins.<br><br>
Still stuck in <b>Vim</b> to this day, starting to develop Stockholm syndrom.<br>

Two gold rules to make stuff work:<br><br>
<ol>
  <li>If it doesn't work but it should and you don't know why: <u><b>Recompile and re-run</b></li><br>
  <li>If it works and you don't know why: <b>Don't touch it and push it</b></li><br>
</ol>
